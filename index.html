        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p class="about-note">
          <a class="a" href="">Lorem</a>Ilerioluwa Oladimeji Aloba (8 June 1996
          – 12 September 2023), known professionally as MohBad, was a Nigerian
          rapper, singer, and songwriter from Lagos. He was formerly signed to
          Naira Marley's Marlian Records and left the label in 2022. He was best
          known for his hit singles "Ponmo, Feel Good", and "KPK (Ko Por Ke)"
          (You Will Always Be Remembered) with Rexxie which was nominated three
          times for The Headies awards 2022.Ilerioluwa Oladimeji Aloba was born
          in Ketu, Lagos state, Nigeria.MohBad released his debut album, Light,
          in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a follow-up to his viral song
          "Ponmo," which featured Naira Marley and Lil Kesh.[4][unreliable
          source?] MohBad was nominated five times for The Beatz Awards 2021.[5]
          MohBad was listed in Audiomack's top 21 Afrobeat artists of 2021.[6]
          In 2022, he released Peace, produced by Rexxie.[7] He peaked on
          TurnTable charts top 50 in 2021 and top 100 in 2022.[8] Peace record
          also peaked number one Apple Music Chart Nigeria.Mohbad's EP Blessed,
          his first after leaving Marlian Records World, was released in June
          2023 under his own label, Imolenization. The eight songs on the
          20-minute EP featured Nigerian artists Zlatan and Bella Shmurda, and
          producers Niphkeys and Timi Jay. The album charted at number one on
          Apple Music in Nigeria the week it was released, and subsequently,
          immediately after his death.MohBad issued his first EP, Light, after
          agreeing to a record deal with Marlian Records World in 2019. The
          eight songs on the EP feature Davido, Naira Marley, and Lil Kesh.[12]
          Naira Marley served as executive producer for the eight-track EP,
          which also bears the production stamps of SB, Rexxie, P.Beat, and
          Austin Sinister. In February 2022, the National Drug Law Enforcement
          Agency (NDLEA) arrested MohBad, Zinoleesky, and four others at their
          home in Lekki, Lagos for possession of illegal substances that
          included MDMA and cannabis.[14][15][16] Some viral videos on social
          media showed NDLEA operatives breaking into the musicians’ home in the
          Lekki district of Lagos State in the early hours of Thursday
          morning.[17] According to witnesses, the officials carried out the
          arrest without any search warrants and mistreated the Marlian singers.
          The NDLEA officers were seen hitting the musicians with clubs and
          shooting into the air, forcing them into waiting trucks.[18] NDLEA
          confirmed the raid, stating "our men raided an area in Idado estate
          where Naira Marley’s boys stay."[19] According to a spokesperson for
          the NDLEA, cannabis and MDMA was found in their apartment and car.[20]
          MohBad, Zinoleesky, and four others were later released. After two
          years, he announced his departure from Marlian Records. On 5 October
          2022, MohBad accused his manager, singer Naira Marley, of assault and
          stated that his former boss ordered people to beat him up after he
          announced his intention to employ a different manager to handle his
          music and business affairs.[22][23][24] After MohBad's death, it was
          reported that he had filed a police report in June 2023 alleging that
          Samson Erinfolami Balogun, a music promoter nicknamed "Sam Larry" and
          a known associate of Marley's, had assaulted him and destroyed some of
          his property. In the report, MohBad said that Larry had interrupted a
          video shoot, leading a group of 15 men armed with firearms and
          cutlasses who claimed to work for monarch Oba Elegushi.[25] Police
          later said MohBad had not attended a subsequent meeting to address the
          allegations, and that Balogun and others accused of the assault had
          then filed a defamation complaint.[26] Elegushi released a statement
          distancing himself from Balogun and expressing condolences on MohBad's
          death. MohBad and his wife, Wunmi, had one son.[28] MohBad died after
          allegedly being treated for an infection on 12 September 2023, at the
          age of 27.[29][30] Police subsequently announced they would
          investigate the circumstances of the singer's death.Rest in Light
